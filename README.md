# Example of TCP server with POW anti-spam defence (Hashcash algorithm)
## Descripton
This code is not production ready. This only demonstrates an approximate approach to solving the spam problem.
The algorithm "Hashcash" was chosen because it has proven itself well in existing anti-spam solutions. In addition, this algorithm allows you to flexibly change the complexity of the calculation
## Running
1. run server by ```make up-server```
2. run client (in different terminal window) by ```make up-client```
3. see results in both consoles
4. finish server by ```ctrl+c```
